# Study-performance analysis on SQL
This repository contains SQL scripts and documentation for analyzing a dataset related to study performance metrics.

Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset containing various metrics related to student performance in a study or academic setting using SQL queries. The dataset includes information such as student gender, math_scores, reading_scores, writing_scores, race ethnicity, parents educational level, and potentially other relevant factors.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in a SQL database. It includes tables with the following structure:

gender: Contains information about students gender.
race_ethnicity: Contains information about race group of students.
Parental_level_of_education: Contains information about parent's level of education.
lunch: Contains information about students that eat free lunch or standard lunch.
Test_preparation_course: contains information about students who complete or did not complete the test preparation course.
math_score
reading_score
writing_score

## Analysis
The main goal of the analysis is to explore relationships between different variables in the dataset and identify factors that may influence student performance. The analysis includes:

Data Exploration: Writing SQL queries to retrieve and summarize data from different tables.
Using Group  by functions
Aggregation: Calculating summary statistics and aggregating data to gain insights.
Usage
To reproduce the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:

Access the SQL database containing the dataset.
Execute the SQL scripts provided in the sql_analysis directory. These scripts contain SQL queries for performing various analyses on the dataset.

## Conclusion
Analyzing student study performance using SQL provides valuable insights that can be used to enhance teaching strategies, student support programs, and overall educational outcomes. By leveraging data-driven insights, educators and administrators can make informed decisions to improve student success and engagement.
