# Study-performance
Welcome to the README file for the study performance dataset SQL analysis project. This repository contains SQL scripts and documentation for analyzing a dataset related to study performance metrics.

Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset containing various metrics related to student performance in a study or academic setting using SQL queries. The dataset includes information such as student demographics, academic scores, study habits, and potentially other relevant factors.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in a SQL database. It includes tables with the following structure:

gender: Contains information about students gender.
race_ethnicity: Contains information about race group of students.
Parental_level_of_education: Contains information about parent's level of education.
lunch: Contains information about students that eat free lunch or standard lunch.
Test_preparation_course: contains information about students who complete or did not complete the test preparation course.
math_score
reading_score
writing_score

## Analysis
The main goal of the analysis is to explore relationships between different variables in the dataset and identify factors that may influence student performance. The analysis includes:

Data Exploration: Writing SQL queries to retrieve and summarize data from different tables.
Using Group  by functions
Aggregation: Calculating summary statistics and aggregating data to gain insights.
Usage
To reproduce the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:

Access the SQL database containing the dataset.
Execute the SQL scripts provided in the sql_analysis directory. These scripts contain SQL queries for performing various analyses on the dataset.
